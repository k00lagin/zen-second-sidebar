# Second Sidebar for Firefox

A Firefox userChrome.js script for adding a second sidebar with web panels like in Vivaldi/Floorp/Zen but better.

## Motivation

There are many forks of Firefox, but I prefer to continue using the original browser. However, I have also tried other browsers such as Vivaldi, Floorp and Zen. I also miss the feature of having a decent sidebar with web panels, which is why I decided to create my own version, with blackjack and hookers.
